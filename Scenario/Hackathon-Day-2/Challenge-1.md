# Challenge 01: Continuous Integration and Deployment for Contoso Traders using GitHub Actions

### Estimated Time: 90 Minutes

## Introduction:
This challenge is designed to evaluate your skills in creating a robust CI/CD pipeline leveraging GitHub Actions. It aims to assess your capability to not only establish a seamless pipeline but also to guarantee the successful deployment of the application.

You are a DevOps engineer tasked with setting up a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for an e-commerce application named Contoso Traders. The goal is to set up a GitHub repository, implement a CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions, deploy the application to Azure, and make rolling updates to the repository.

## Challenge Objectives:

>**Note:** Only use GitHub and GitHub Actions for CI/CD; no usage of Azure DevOps or any external CI/CD services.

1. **Setup a GitHub repository:**
   - Create a new GitHub repository with public access permission.

   <validation step="6b3463a9-eca3-4377-b04c-9c04afe4ebb1" />
   
      - You are provided with an e-commerce application named Contoso Traders, which needs to be deployed and hosted on Azure.
      - You can navigate to the `C:\Workspaces\lab\DevOps-DevSecOps-Hackathon-lab-files` directory and find the complete code base of the application.
      - Using Visual Studio Code, connect to the GitHub repository that you created in the earlier step and push the application code base to your GitHub repository.

<validation step="748366ea-c3bf-4783-ac55-ba773159b299" />

2. **Deploy Infrastructure:**
   - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the settings and add GitHub action secret and variable as below.
     - Create GitHub secrets with the same name as mentioned below.
        - **SERVICEPRINCIPAL:** Create a secret to store service principal details. You can find the details in the Environment details tab of your environment.
          
          ```json
          {
            "clientId": "zzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzzzzzz",
            "clientSecret": "zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz",
            "tenantId": "zzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzzzzzz",
            "subscriptionId": "zzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzzzzzz"
          }
          ```  
  
        - **SQLPASSWORD:** You need to enter any unique password with a combination of Alphanumeric letters. Your password must contain characters from three of the following categories â€“ English uppercase letters, English lowercase letters, numbers (0-9), and non-alphanumeric characters (!, $, #, %, etc.).
     
     - Create GitHub variables with the same name as mentioned below.   
        - **DEPLOYMENTREGION:** Add the deployment region where you want to get the resources deployed. preferenced **eastus2,uksouth,australiaeast**
      
        - **SUFFIX:** Create a variables to store the deployment ID which is **<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**.
       
       >**Hint:** You can also find the deployment ID and the Azure AD password within the environment details tab of your integrated lab guide.
