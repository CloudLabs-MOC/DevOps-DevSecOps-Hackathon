## Challenge Objectives:

>**Note:** Only use GitHub and GitHub Actions for CI/CD; no usage of Azure DevOps or any external CI/CD services.

1. **Setup a GitHub repository:**
   - Create a new GitHub repository in organization.
     
   <validation step="5b252fb5-a2f0-4c4c-8b1d-af806a115039" />
      
      - You are provided with an e-commerce application named Contoso Traders, which needs to be deployed and hosted on Azure.
      - You can navigate to the `C:\Workspaces\lab\DevOps-DevSecOps-Hackathon-lab-files` directory and find the complete code base of the application.
      - Using Visual Studio Code, connect to the GitHub repository that you created in the earlier step and push the application code base to your GitHub repository.
      
      <validation step="d239841d-b8fe-43cb-8170-54bf67f11c8c" />

2. **Deploy Infrastructure:**
